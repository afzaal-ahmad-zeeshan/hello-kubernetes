# Hello Kubernetes
_Hello Kubernetes_ is always the toughest part of working with Kubernetes. In my upcoming course **Hands-on Azure Kubernetes Service** with Packt Publishing I explore the overall deployment, management, and provisioning of Kubernetes clusters on Microsoft Azure. The course is high-level and discusses more about Microsoft Azure as a platform for Kubernetes deployments and managements, without discussing about the basics of Kubernetes&mdash;although I have tried my best to explain the science behind the Kubernetes objects. 

In this repository the common Kubernetes files are available that work, and can help you follow along with the course&mdash;or at your own pace if you do not take the course.
